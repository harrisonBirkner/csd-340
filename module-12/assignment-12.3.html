                        My board game collection has grown to include over 20 different games, spanning genres like roleplaying, puzzle, collaborative, and party. I have always thought board games are an easy way to bring a group together.

                        Since I was a freshman in high school, I have been fascinated with the Rubik's Cube. Throughout my time in high school and beyond, I amassed a small collection of 15 Rubik's Cubes of varying shape and size. The thing I love most is the challenge of a new puzzle, I'm always looking for my next one!

                        I was accepted into Principal's internship program for the summer of 2020 as a software engineer. I worked on a team that mainly supported java components of our loans system. At the end of the summer, I was offered an extended internship and was moved to another team that mainly supported cobol and other legacy pieces of our loans system. In August of 2021, I was offered, and accepted, a full-time position on that same team I had been on since the end of summer 2020.

                        Python is of great interest to me in the world of software engineering. I have always loved how versatile the language is. I have often described writing in python as "quick and dirty code" because of how the simple syntax allows even mildly complex programs to be started fairly quickly. While it isn't necessarily an end all be all, it allows an engineer to quickly test out ideas without much overhead.
